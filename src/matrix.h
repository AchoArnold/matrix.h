 * @file matrix.h
 *
 * @brief Matrices
 *
 * This header file contains all the functions which can be used to  manipulate the
 * matrices so as to obtain required outputs.
 * 
 * To create a new matrix, you will have to allocate space for the matrix using
 *  @ref matrix_alloc or @ref matrix_callalloc
 * 
 * To  copy  a matrix into another, use @ref matrix_copy.
 * 
 * To multiply two matrices, use @ref matrix_multiply.
 * 
 * To multiply a matrix by itself 'n' times (i.e raise the matrix to the nth power)
 * use @ref matrix_pow.
 * 
 * To add or subtract two matrices, use @ref matrix_add or @ref  matrix_subtract 
 * respectively.
 * 
 * To perform LU decomposition of a matrix, use @ref LU_decompose.
 * 
 * To perform row echelon reduction of a particular matrix, use
 * @ref matrix_row_reduce.
 * 
 * To print the matrix at any time, use @ref matrix_print or @ref matrix_print_part
 * 
 * The function @ref row_divide is  used as an accessory function in  other functions
 * to divide a row of a matrix by a specific value.
 * 
 * The function  @ref row_operation is used as an accessory function in other 
 * functions to perform row operations on a matrix.
 * 
* The function  @ref matrix_equal_size checks if two matrices have the same 
 * number or rows and columns
